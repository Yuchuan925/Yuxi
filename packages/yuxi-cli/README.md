# @xerrors/yuxi

Yuxi Public v1 command-line client. Requires Node.js 22 or newer.

```bash
npm install --global @xerrors/yuxi
yuxi remote add production https://example.com
yuxi remote use production
yuxi login
yuxi agent list
yuxi chat --agent default-chatbot
yuxi kb query --kb-id <id> "your question"
```

Configuration is stored at `~/.yuxi/config.json` with restrictive file permissions. The first release focuses on authentication, Public Agent/Thread APIs, terminal chat, SSE observation, and knowledge-base retrieval. Eval, Langfuse, and administration APIs are not included.

Upload a draft before sending a file attachment. Uploading does not create a Session or write to its Workdir. Read the returned `id` and pass it with a message:

```bash
yuxi file upload ./report.pdf --mime-type application/pdf
yuxi thread send <session-id> "Summarize the report" --file-id <returned-id>
yuxi file show <draft-id>
yuxi file delete <unsubmitted-draft-id>
```

For inline vision input, `thread send --image-url` accepts a complete `data:image/png;base64,...` URL. It preserves the MIME type and does not call private image preprocessing. Draft expiry, submission and recovery follow the [Public API contract](../../docs/advanced/agents-public-api.md#图片与文件附件).

Lists and history are pages: use `--limit`, `--order` and the returned `last_id` as `--after`. Turn lists include work that produced no message.

```bash
yuxi thread list --limit 20
yuxi thread history <session-id> --limit 20 --after <last-id>
yuxi thread turns <session-id>
yuxi thread send <session-id> "Continue" --idempotency-key <saved-key>
yuxi thread receipt <session-id> <saved-key>
yuxi thread input <session-id> <input-id>
yuxi thread turn <session-id> <turn-id>
```

`send` prints its key before submitting. If the response is lost, it first reads the same key's receipt; retry the original command with that key when reception remains unknown. Input identifies the consumed Turn. Interactive chat reconnects with its cursor and reads that Turn's persistent output, including when no text delta was received. A closed stream or another Turn's completion does not finish the current request. User answers and approvals can continue in the Web interface; cooperation waits remain observed by chat.
